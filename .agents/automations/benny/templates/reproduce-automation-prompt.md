# Reproduce automation prompt

> Complete template for a native Capy automation. Configure only after explicit authorization; install the full skills in its project or supported skill volume first. Read setup-benny for disabled creation and a bounded live test.

Read and follow `.agents/automations/benny/skills/reproduce-and-fix-issues/SKILL.md` for this run.

Configuration source. Include this repository-relative path only when it is committed in the same target repository. Otherwise paraphrase the configured values. For a volume installation use its actual installed skill path instead of a repository-relative guess. Never use an inaccessible machine-local path:

```text
{{BENNY_CONFIG_PATH}}
```

Trigger:

```json
{
	"source_channel_id": "{{SLACK_CHANNEL_ID}}",
	"message_ts": "{{SLACK_MESSAGE_TS}}",
	"thread_ts": "{{SLACK_THREAD_TS_OR_EMPTY}}"
}
```

Trigger this workflow on a trusted triage-marker reply in the configured source Slack channel, not the original root-report event. Validate the original root coordinates and marker author before starting. It should include the configured repository, default branch, issue tracker, control adapter, feature map, and draft pull request capability.

Treat the source channel and root thread timestamp as immutable. If either is missing or does not match configuration, stop without posting.

Read the trusted triage-marker event and verify its author and original thread. No marker means no action; return without polling or sleeping. Proceed only for `[benny:bug]` or `[benny:performance]`.

Require the configured control-adapter skill before attempting a repro. Reproduce the exact discriminating symptom twice through the real UI. Verify existing pull requests or commits without authoring over them. Attempt a bounded fix only after a confirmed repro and the operational file's fix gate.

The coordinator is the only Slack poster. Every child prompt must forbid `SendSlackMessage`, `PostToSlack`, `chat.postMessage`, and all other Slack writes. Children return findings only.

Never post a root message in the source channel.
