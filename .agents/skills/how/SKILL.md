# How

Explore the codebase to answer "how does X work?" questions. Produce architectural explanations at the level of a senior engineer onboarding onto a subsystem, enough to build a working mental model, not so much that it reads like annotated source code.

## Step 1. Assess Complexity

If the scope is ambiguous, state your interpretation and explore. The user can redirect.

- **Simple** (a single module, a small utility, a narrow question such as "how does function X work"): no explorers. One explainer explores and explains in a single pass. Go to Step 2b.
- **Complex** (a subsystem spanning multiple files or services, a cross-cutting feature, a full architectural overview): spawn parallel explorers first, then hand off to the explainer. Go to Step 2a.

When in doubt, take the simple path.

## Step 2a. Explore (complex questions only)

Decompose the question into 2 to 4 exploration angles, each a distinct slice of the subsystem. Spawn all explorers in a single message:

- `model`: your configured how-explorer model (default `inherit-parent`)
- Read-only scope on a shared Capy machine; return the report as a task message.

Each explorer gets the prompt in `references/explorer-prompt.md` with its angle filled in. Then go to Step 3.

## Step 2b. Direct Explain (simple questions)

Spawn one native Capy task that explores and explains in one pass:

- `model`: your configured how-explainer model (default `inherit-parent`)
- Read-only scope on a shared Capy machine; return the report as a task message.

Build its prompt from `references/explainer-prompt.md` without the explorer-findings section. Go to Step 4.

## Step 3. Synthesize (complex questions only)

Once all explorers have returned, spawn one native Capy task to synthesize their findings into one explanation:

- `model`: your configured how-explainer model (default `inherit-parent`)
- Read-only scope on a shared Capy machine; return the report as a task message.

Build its prompt from `references/explainer-prompt.md` with every explorer's findings filled in.

## Step 4. Present

Present the explainer's output to the user. Light edits for clarity or context from the conversation are fine. Do not substantially rewrite it.

## Output Format

The explanation uses the sections defined in `references/explainer-prompt.md`, dropping any that do not apply: Overview, Key Concepts, How It Works, Where Things Live, Gotchas.

## Capy task execution

Draft each child with its complete goal, exact repository and base commit, writable
scope, acceptance checks, standing instructions, and the skill/reference paths to read.
Children do not inherit this conversation. Resolve roles/ and skills/ from the observed
bundle root (.agents in a project, or the selected volume root), never the child
working directory. Select a shared machine for a read-only
investigation of this checkout, or a fresh machine for any writer or candidate artifact.
A report returned in the task message is not a filesystem write. Verify the placement
and machine ID returned at start. Use `transfer_files` for inputs and reports crossing
machines; a path on another machine is not an accessible input.

Read the selected role from `pstack.models.json` at the bundle root, then apply an
explicit project `.agents/pstack.models.json` override. Absent configuration means
`inherit-parent`: omit the native model override. Recheck configured IDs against the
current account. Four-seat design/review panels retain four independent seats by
default; report same-model seats honestly rather than claiming model diversity.

Use the native task tools available in this session, not a shell that starts another
agent. Drafts are not running, working/waiting tasks remain live, and idle/stopped is
not completion. Accept a final report only after `done` plus evidence inspection.
Send follow-up fixes to the existing owner. Do not replace a timed-out owner until
its stop or terminal failure and its filesystem/branch have been reconciled.
Independent writers need disjoint paths. A dependent writer starts at its predecessor's
actual accepted branch/head, not just later from main. At three child levels, execute
the next step in the current owner rather than spawning a fourth level.
