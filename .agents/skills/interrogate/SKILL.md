# Interrogate

Spawn one reviewer per configured model to adversarially review code changes. Each model gets the same prompt and rubric. The adversarial signal comes from model diversity, not assigned personas.

The deliverable is a synthesized verdict. Do NOT auto-apply changes.

## Step 1, Determine Scope

Identify what to review from context:

- If the user points at specific files or a diff, use that
- If on a feature branch, run `git diff main...HEAD` (or the appropriate base branch) for the full changeset
- If the user's message references recent work, gather the relevant files

Package the diff (or file contents) plus any surrounding context files the reviewers need to understand the code.

## Step 2, State the Intent

Before spawning reviewers, state the intent explicitly. Derive this from:

- The user's message
- Commit messages
- PR description if one exists
- The code itself

Write one clear paragraph. If you're unsure about the intent, ask the user before proceeding.

## Step 3, Spawn Reviewers

Draft independent read-only Capy review tasks with the same exact diff, intent and rubric.
Resolve `interrogate reviewers` through models.py using the active profile and current
account observations. Use the configured panel from the model policy, whose default has two independent model families. A repeated
same-model panel requires an explicitly approved single-model/custom profile, not fallback.
Choose shared machines for a stable current checkout or isolated device worktrees on device threads and fresh cloud machines on cloud threads, pinned to the PR
head for an independent checkout. Wait for all final reports; a timeout is still pending.
An unavailable model blocks that seat until an authorized replacement is selected.
Do not silently substitute providers or count the implementer as independent review.

Read `references/reviewer-prompt.md` and fill in the template with:
1. The stated intent
2. The diff or file contents
3. The review rubric from `references/rubric.md`
4. The code-quality lens from `references/code-quality-review.md`

The same filled template goes to all reviewers, so every model applies the code-quality lens.

## Step 4, Synthesize

As results come back, build a unified picture:

1. **Parse all findings** from the reviewers
2. **Identify consensus**. Findings raised by 2+ models independently are highest signal.
3. **Identify lone-model findings**. Still worth reading, but weight accordingly.
4. **Deduplicate**. Different models may describe the same issue differently. Merge these and note which models raised it.
5. **Note disagreements**. If one model flags something and another explicitly says the opposite, that's useful context for the verdict.

## Step 5, Lead Judgment

You are the lead reviewer, a pragmatic senior engineer, not a neutral aggregator.

Read `references/lead-judgment.md` for the full framework.

Categorize every finding using these buckets:

- **Act on**. Real issues affecting correctness, security, or maintainability given the actual goals. These would block a real PR.
- **Consider**. Legitimate points, but you're not sure they outweigh the cost of addressing them right now. Worth the user's attention.
- **Noted**. Technically valid but not actionable. Context-dependent, premature optimization, or low-impact given the current stage.
- **Dismissed**. Wrong, nitpicky, or missing context. Brief explanation why.

For each finding, include:
- Which model(s) raised it
- The category (act on / consider / noted / dismissed)
- A one-line rationale for the categorization

## Output Format

Present the verdict in this structure:

### Intent
> [The stated intent paragraph from Step 2]

### Reviewers
- Reviewer [label]: [model name], [N findings] (one bullet per reviewer)

### Act On
[Findings that should be addressed. For each: description, which models raised it, why it matters.]

### Consider
[Findings worth thinking about. For each: description, which models raised it, tradeoff involved.]

### Noted
[Valid but low-priority. Brief list.]

### Dismissed
[Rejected findings with brief rationale.]

### Agreement Map
[Where did models agree, where did they diverge, and what does the pattern of agreement/disagreement tell us?]

## Capy task execution

Draft each child with its complete goal, exact repository and accepted base, writable
scope, acceptance checks, standing instructions, and full skill/reference paths.
Children do not inherit this conversation. Resolve roles/ and skills/ from the observed
bundle root (.agents in a project, or the selected volume root), not the child directory.
Read-only investigations use `machine: "shared"`. Writers use `machine: "device"` for an
isolated sibling worktree on a device-attached thread, or `machine: "fresh"` for an isolated
cloud machine on a cloud thread. A new agent does not imply a cloud machine. Use coordinated
disjoint shared writing only when explicitly assigned, with one git writer and no concurrent
commits. Verify returned placement and machine ID. Transfer uncommitted inputs and reports
with `transfer_files` when machines differ; a remote path is not an accessible input.

Resolve every role, reasoning budget, alias and panel through
`skills/poteto-mode/references/model-policy.md` at the observed bundle root. Run its
models.py resolver with current account observations before launch, and inspect returned
native settings. The policy owns defaults and unsupported-setting handling. Never silently
substitute models, infer diversity from aliases, or overwrite an existing user profile.

Use native task tools, not a shell that starts agents. Drafts are not running;
working/waiting owners remain live, and idle/stopped is not completion. Accept a final
report only with terminal completion and inspected evidence. Independent new rounds use
fresh agent context with consolidated scope: the original brief, every later directive,
the accepted report, exact head, and transferred inputs. Keep an existing live owner when
callbacks, its local checkout, uncommitted work, or running processes require it. Before a
completed role passes to a new agent, reconcile the filesystem, branch, processes and PR
callback ownership. A timeout never permits a second writer. Stop or reconcile terminal
failure before replacement. A dependent writer starts at its predecessor's accepted head,
not merely later from main. At three child levels, execute rather than spawn a fourth.

Implementation and playbook helpers read the complete poteto-mode skill and
`roles/poteto-agent.md`. Investigation, reflection and adversarial review use their own
full templates. Tier code work by difficulty through the configured policy, including
`hardest tasks` and `judgment and prose`. The parent inspects each diff and writes its own
synthesis. A second opinion uses the same brief against a different resolved model.
