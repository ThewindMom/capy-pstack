# Automate me

A guided flow for turning the user's working conventions into a skill agents will follow. The output is one `-mode` skill tailored to them (e.g. `jay-mode`, `priya-mode`).

This skill orchestrates three others: an inline mining pass (see step 1), the bundled `create-skill` (authoring), and the **unslop** skill (prose discipline). It sequences them. It doesn't replace them.

## Flow

### 0. Check for an existing skill

Look recursively for `.agents/skills/**/*-mode/SKILL.md` and `<selected-personal-volume>/skills/*-mode/SKILL.md` matching the user's handle. Mode skills can live in a personal category directory (`.agents/skills/<handle>/`), not only at the top level. If one exists, confirm intent with the session's question tool (unless they already said "update my skill" or similar):

- Update the existing skill (default for repeat runs)
- Start fresh (rare, ask why before doing it)

Update mode changes the rest of the flow:
- Step 1 mines only history since the skill was last edited (`git log -1 --format=%cI <path>`).
- Step 2 asks what's changed or missing, not what to capture from zero.
- Step 4 edits the existing file in place. Preserve sections the user hasn't contradicted. Revise ones with new evidence. Add new sections only for genuinely new rules.

### 1. Mine their history

List and read only authorized Capy threads/tasks for the active project. Pin a time range, preserve timestamps and IDs, and pass reviewers the relevant messages or a clearly labelled digest. Do not search another project without authorization.

Survey recent agent conversations within that scope for recurring patterns. Run multiple parallel subagents across slices of history (e.g. last 2-4 weeks, split into 3 slices so each has enough material). Each slice mining subagent reads transcripts from the workspace-scoped path the parent provides, looks for the signals below, and returns a short structured list of patterns it saw with evidence pointers. Default signals worth hunting:

- Response preferences (length, tone, format, "dumb it down" corrections)
- Delegation habits (subagents, models, specialized workflows, parallelism)
- Verification posture (what "done" means, unit tests vs live repro, reviewers)
- Code and prose discipline (style, principles cited, lint/format tools)
- Process conventions (worktrees, commits, PRs, review/merge tooling)
- Meta preferences (fixing skills mid-task, proposing new ones)

Cross-check across slices before elevating a signal. Patterns seen in 2+ slices are high-confidence. Lone signals are weak and usually get dropped.

### 2. Ask the user directly

Mining misses intent that hasn't come up yet. Use the session's question tool (structured multi-choice) rather than asking the user to type from scratch.

Shape: one or two questions with 4-6 options each, `allow_multiple: true` for category questions. Start broad ("Which areas matter most?"), then follow up on selected areas with specific options. After the structured rounds, one free-form chat question catches anything the options missed.

Don't dump 20 questions.

### 3. Cluster findings

Group the combined signals into sections. Common ones (use only what applies):

- **Response style**: length, tone, format.
- **Autonomy**: how much to do without asking, MCP tool use.
- **Understand first**: which skills to reach for when scoping or investigating a change.
- **Subagents**: default, parallelism, model-to-task, specialized workflows.
- **Prose / code discipline**: principles, lint tools, style guides.
- **Review and verify**: repro posture, verification skills, live-testing tools.
- **Process**: git worktrees, commits, PRs, review/merge tooling.
- **Skills**: skill-authoring habits, fix-the-skill-first, proposing new skills.

The **poteto-mode** skill shows the shape. Read it for granularity. Don't copy its content. The user's rules are not the same as poteto-mode's.

### 4. Draft the skill

Use the bundled `create-skill` skill to author the skill. Placement:

- Path: preserve an existing mode skill's category. For a new mode, use `.agents/skills/<handle>/<handle>-mode/SKILL.md` when the repo has an established personal category for that handle. Otherwise default to `.agents/skills/<handle>-mode/SKILL.md` in the project (or `<selected-personal-volume>/skills/<handle>-mode/` if the user prefers a personal skill).
- Handle: the user's first name or chosen identifier.
- Frontmatter `description`: trigger on their name + `/<handle>-mode` + "work in their style", not on generic keywords like "write code" or "review PR".
- Frontmatter formatting: follow `create-skill`'s YAML rules. Keep `description` as one YAML scalar. Quote it or use `description: >-` with indented continuation lines when punctuation or wrapping requires it.
- Keep the description narrowly opt-in to the named mode. Use a scoped always-applied rule only when the user explicitly wants it every turn; there is no mode-registration frontmatter.

### 5. Iterate on prose

Apply the **unslop** skill and `create-skill`'s writing guidelines to every line.

Show the draft to the user and take feedback. Expect multiple iterations. Cut ruthlessly. A mode skill is not a manual.

### 6. Land it

Work in a worktree off main. Commit and open a PR. Don't push to main directly.

## Guardrails

- **Don't overfit to one conversation.** A preference stated once and contradicted another time is noise. Require multiple instances before codifying it.
- **Don't be clever.** Restating other skills' contents, inventing metaphors, or writing "poetic" prose for an agent reader is cost without benefit. Keep it operational.
- **Reference, don't inline.** Other skills the user relies on should appear as path references, not pasted excerpts. Same for any principle docs they maintain elsewhere.
- **Keep sections minimal.** Only add a section if the user has a specific, non-default rule there. "Communicate clearly" is not a section. "Short paragraphs. Tables when comparing options. Bullets only when items are genuinely parallel." is.
- **Name conventions generic.** Use "the user" or "the human" in imperatives, not the author's first name.
- **Don't force symmetry.** If a user has no process rules worth writing down, skip the Process section entirely.

## Evaluation

A `-mode` skill is subjective output. A `create-skill`-style test/iterate benchmark loop isn't useful here. Vibe-check with the user: does it read like them? Did it miss anything? Then ship.

Run a description-optimization loop only if the skill's trigger accuracy turns out to be a problem in practice.

## When not to use

- User wants a task-specific skill (not working conventions): `create-skill` alone, no mining required.
- User wants to capture one narrow workflow (e.g. "how I write commit messages"). That's a regular skill, not a mode skill.


## Capy task execution

Draft each child with its complete goal, exact repository and base commit, writable
scope, acceptance checks, standing instructions, and the skill/reference paths to read.
Children do not inherit this conversation. Resolve roles/ and skills/ from the observed
bundle root (.agents in a project, or the selected volume root), never the child
working directory. Select a shared machine for a read-only
investigation of this checkout, or a fresh machine for any writer or candidate artifact.
A report returned in the task message is not a filesystem write. Verify the placement
and machine ID returned at start. Use `transfer_files` for inputs and reports crossing
machines; a path on another machine is not an accessible input.

Read the selected role from `pstack.models.json` at the bundle root, with the project
profile overriding matching fields. Absent configuration uses `upstream-faithful` from
`pstack.model-presets.json`. Follow `skills/poteto-mode/references/model-policy.md` at
that root and run its models.py resolver with current account observations before launch.
Preserve the role-specific model, reasoning effort, priority and panel count. Unsupported
settings block the affected seat; never silently inherit or substitute. Same-model/custom
profiles require an explicit user-approved difference. Four faithful seats are four models
across three families. Inspect returned native settings, not only the requested prompt.

Use the native task tools available in this session, not a shell that starts another
agent. Drafts are not running, working/waiting tasks remain live, and idle/stopped is
not completion. Accept a final report only after `done` plus evidence inspection.
Send follow-up fixes to the existing owner. Do not replace a timed-out owner until
its stop or terminal failure and its filesystem/branch have been reconciled.
Independent writers need disjoint paths. A dependent writer starts at its predecessor's
actual accepted branch/head, not just later from main. At three child levels, execute
the next step in the current owner rather than spawning a fourth level.
