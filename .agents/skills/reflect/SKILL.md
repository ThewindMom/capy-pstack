description: Spawn three parallel review subagents over the active transcript, surface learnings, and route each to a concrete edit on an existing skill. Use when the user says reflect.

# Reflect

Mine the current conversation for durable learnings, then route them into skill edits.

## When to invoke

Invoke when the user says "reflect" or "/reflect". Skip when the conversation is trivial, off-topic, or already covered by an existing skill the parent followed correctly. One-offs are not learnings.

## Process

### 1. Locate the active transcript

Read the active Capy thread and its relevant task messages using the native readers.
Keep their real thread/task IDs, message order and referenced artifact locations. Export
only authorized relevant messages to a per-run file when reviewers need a file, and use
transfer_files across machines. There is no assumed editor transcript directory. If the
full history is unavailable, label the gap and supply a clearly marked session digest.

### 2. Spawn three reviewers in parallel

Draft three read-only native tasks on shared machines for the three lenses below.
Include the scoped transcript or digest and each full template. Read-only scope is an
instruction not a claim that it removes MCP access; use only authorized read tools.

| Lens | `model` | Prompt template |
|---|---|---|
| Judgment | your configured reflect-judgment model (resolved through the model policy) | `references/judgment-reviewer.md` |
| Tooling | your configured reflect-tooling model (resolved through the model policy) | `references/tooling-reviewer.md` |
| Divergent | your configured reflect-divergent model (resolved through the model policy) | `references/divergent-reviewer.md` |

Pass each template verbatim, substituting the transcript path or digest where marked. Reviewers return findings in the native task final report.

### 3. Synthesize

Draft one independent native synthesis task using the configured reflect synthesizer model or parent inheritance. Allow authorized read-only citation checks. Use `references/synthesizer.md` verbatim, with each reviewer's full output inlined where marked. The synthesizer returns a structured Accepted / Rejected / Backlog list.

### 4. Structural enforcement check

Sanity-check the synthesizer's Accepted list. For any item that would be enforced more reliably by a lint rule, script, metadata flag, or runtime check, move it from Accepted to Backlog. See the **encode-lessons-in-structure** principle skill.

### 5. Apply

Before applying any Accepted edit, present the synthesizer's full Accepted/Rejected/Backlog output to the user and wait for explicit approval. The user picks which subset to apply and may redirect routings. Skill changes affect every future agent in the org. Do not auto-apply.

File Backlog items only when tracker writes are authorized; otherwise report them as proposals. Only the Accepted list waits for approval.

For each approved Accepted item, follow the Routing field exactly:

- Trivial existing-skill edit (a one-line bullet, a tightened sentence, a stale fact corrected): parent does directly.
- Substantive existing-skill edit (a new section, a new pattern table, more than ~10 lines): hand to the bundled `create-skill` skill and run its draft / test / iterate loop.
- `tune description: <skill path>` (the skill exists but didn't trigger when it should have): hand to `create-skill` and run its description-optimization loop.
- `new skill via create-skill: <kebab-name>`: hand creation to `create-skill`. Do not invent the shape ad hoc.

If your environment ships a SKILL.md validator, run it on every touched skill before declaring done. Skip this step if it doesn't.

### 6. Summarize for the user

Short list, no preamble:

- Edits applied: `<skill path>`. What changed, one line each.
- New skills created: `<skill path>`. One line each (rare).
- Backlog filed to the devex tracker: `<issue title>` (`<tags>`). One line each.
- Dropped: one line per rejected finding + reason from the synthesizer.

## Capy task execution

Draft each child with its complete goal, exact repository and accepted base, writable
scope, acceptance checks, standing instructions, and full skill/reference paths.
Children do not inherit this conversation. Resolve roles/ and skills/ from the observed
bundle root (.agents in a project, or the selected volume root), not the child directory.
Read-only investigations use `machine: "shared"`. Writers use `machine: "device"` for an
isolated sibling worktree on a device-attached thread, or `machine: "fresh"` for an isolated
cloud machine on a cloud thread. A new agent does not imply a cloud machine. Use coordinated
disjoint shared writing only when explicitly assigned, with one git writer and no concurrent
commits. Verify returned placement and machine ID. Transfer uncommitted inputs and reports
with `transfer_files` when machines differ; a remote path is not an accessible input.

Resolve every role, reasoning budget, alias and panel through
`skills/poteto-mode/references/model-policy.md` at the observed bundle root. Run its
models.py resolver with current account observations before launch, and inspect returned
native settings. The policy owns defaults and unsupported-setting handling. Never silently
substitute models, infer diversity from aliases, or overwrite an existing user profile.

Use native task tools, not a shell that starts agents. Drafts are not running;
working/waiting owners remain live, and idle/stopped is not completion. Accept a final
report only with terminal completion and inspected evidence. Independent new rounds use
fresh agent context with consolidated scope: the original brief, every later directive,
the accepted report, exact head, and transferred inputs. Keep an existing live owner when
callbacks, its local checkout, uncommitted work, or running processes require it. Before a
completed role passes to a new agent, reconcile the filesystem, branch, processes and PR
callback ownership. A timeout never permits a second writer. Stop or reconcile terminal
failure before replacement. A dependent writer starts at its predecessor's accepted head,
not merely later from main. At three child levels, execute rather than spawn a fourth.

Implementation and playbook helpers read the complete poteto-mode skill and
`roles/poteto-agent.md`. Investigation, reflection and adversarial review use their own
full templates. Tier code work by difficulty through the configured policy, including
`hardest tasks` and `judgment and prose`. The parent inspects each diff and writes its own
synthesis. A second opinion uses the same brief against a different resolved model.
